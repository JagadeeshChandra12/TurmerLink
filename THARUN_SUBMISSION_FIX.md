# ðŸ”§ **Tharun's Submissions Not Showing - FIXED**

## âœ… **Problem Identified:**
Tharun's submissions were not appearing in the government portal because:
1. Hardcoded farmer data (always using FARM001 and Ramaiah's name)
2. SubmissionContext was using static demo data
3. No real-time sync with Supabase database

## ðŸ”§ **Solutions Implemented:**

### **1. Dynamic User Data in Submissions**
**Changed:** `MySalesPage` now uses actual logged-in user data
```javascript
const farmerId = user?.id || 'FARM001';
const farmerName = user?.name || 'Farmer';
const farmerPhone = user?.phoneNumber ? `+91 ${user.phoneNumber}` : '+91 0000000000';
const location = user?.location || 'Unknown';
```

### **2. Real-Time Database Sync**
**Changed:** `SubmissionContext` now loads from Supabase every 5 seconds
- Fetches all submissions from database
- Updates government portal automatically
- No manual refresh needed

### **3. Auto-Refresh Implementation**
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  const interval = setInterval(() => {
    loadSubmissions();
  }, 5000); // Refresh every 5 seconds
  
  return () => clearInterval(interval);
}, []);
```

## ðŸŽ¯ **How It Works Now:**

### **Step 1: Farmer Submits**
1. Tharun logs in
2. Goes to "My Sales" â†’ "Submit to Government"
3. System creates submission with **Tharun's actual data**
4. Syncs to Supabase database

### **Step 2: Automatic Sync**
1. SubmissionContext loads from Supabase
2. Shows all submissions in government portal
3. **Tharun's submission appears** with correct name

### **Step 3: Real-Time Updates**
1. Government views portal
2. Sees Tharun's submission (or any farmer's)
3. Approves/Rejects
4. Updates sync back to farmer's account

## ðŸ§ª **Testing Steps:**

1. **Login as Tharun** (phone: your number)
2. **Go to My Sales** page
3. **Click "Submit Stock to Government"**
4. **Fill in crop details** and submit
5. **Check Government Portal** - you should see **Tharun's submission**

## âœ… **Expected Result:**
- Tharun's name appears in government portal
- Correct phone number is shown
- Proper location is displayed
- Real-time updates work
- Both portals stay in sync

**The system now correctly identifies each farmer and their submissions appear in the government portal with their real information!** ðŸŒ±âœ¨
